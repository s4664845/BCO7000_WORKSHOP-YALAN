```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1.Upload tidyverse 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

2.read data from website and name it pizza_barstool

```{r}
pizza_barstool <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-01/pizza_barstool.csv")
```

3. #select  choose any col from data set and form a new table

```{r}
pizza_short <- pizza_barstool %>%
  select(name, city, price_level,  provider_rating, provider_review_count)
```
  
4.#count  aggregate every city and arrange in ascending order


```{r}
pizza_short %>%
  count(city, sort=TRUE)
```


```{r}
pizza_short %>%
  count(city) %>%
  arrange(n) %>%
  top_n(15)
```

aggregate every city and arrange in descending order

```{r}
pizza_short %>%
  count(city) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(15) 
```
  
5. filter list provider rating over 4 and store in good pizza table


```{r}
good_pizza <- pizza_short %>%
  filter(provider_rating >= 4)
```

list provider rating equal to 2

```{r}
bad_pizza <- pizza_short %>%
  filter(provider_rating == 2)
```

  
6. #group_by  


pizza_short %>%
  group_by(city)

pizza_short %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(provider_rating)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_rating))

pizza_short %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  mutate(mean_rating = mean(provider_rating)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_rating))

pizza_short %>%
  mutate(price = price_level * 2)




## R Markdown


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
